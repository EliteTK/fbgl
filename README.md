No longer ABANDONED
===================

~~This is an abandoned project.~~

~~This is a project which I wrote to explore the linux framebuffer. I wrote a simple graphics engine after "conquering" the framebuffer.~~
~~The "engine" provides the ability to draw squares circles and triangles.~~

~~This project was abandoned once it was clear that the base was written badly. It might once be resurrected but for now my time is better served learning about more conventional display methods.~~

~~One final message: My friend framebuffer, you will be sincerely missed.~~

I've had some new ideas for the project and it is now being rewritten at branch rewrite.
Go there youself since I forgot how to link to branches in GFM.
